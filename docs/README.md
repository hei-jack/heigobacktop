## Overview

HeiGoBackTop is more than just a bottom-to-top plug-in. Compared with the traditional back to top plug-in, HeiGoBackTop is more beautiful and more practical.

Whether you want to use it as a simple back to top plug-in, or you want to have more complex personalized operations.

No matter if you are a rookie or an experienced veteran, you only need to [download the source](/quickstart) or [cdn](/quickstart#cdn) to the project. Take off quickly.

It is recommended that novices click [Quick Start](/quickstart) for detailed information, and if there is a programming foundation, it is recommended to directly click [Configuration Items](/configuration).

## Feature

* ~~Installation~~ Simple to use and easy to get started
* Built-in 12 cool themes, one second to choose
* Four sliding modes, switch in one second
